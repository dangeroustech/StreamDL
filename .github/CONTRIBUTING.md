# Contributing to StreamDownloader

:+1: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

## Git Commit Message Best Practice

- Please open an issue with your requested feature/fix/etc first
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standards
- Update any tests that your PR breaks
- PRs should reference the issue they are addressing with `Fixes: 999`

## Submitting Pull Requests

Please always submit PRs to the Staging branch, never to Master.

Features will be moved to Master once they have been adequately tested in Staging.
